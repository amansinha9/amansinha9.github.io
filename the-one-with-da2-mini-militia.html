                <h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>So its all started way back in 2015, when I was in 1st year of my college. I think it was the month of October or November when I first started playing this game. I didnt like it in the first place. Even I had uninstalled it after a day of playing. But then after a month, somehow I got to know about the online multiplayer feature of this game. So once again I was back in this game. And then after sometime I became addicted to it. I used to play it whenever I used to face dejection, sadness etc. Even I was the winner of a Intra-college DA2 championship in my 1st year. </p>
<p>As the addiction got increased so was my interest in finding the loopholes to increase the battle points and experiences(to reach the higher rank) got increased. As I was playing the game online, there were so many players having store pack items and pro pack(which includes double guns, rocket launcher etc). And i on the other hand, nothing.  And the idea to do some research in the database came from this only.</p>
<h2>My Side Of Story</h2>
<p>As my phone was rooted, I was able to access all the data related to each one of the applications i had in my phone through ES file explorer. First task was to find the database folder related to DA2 by going through applications database present in internal storage. This took me just a minute to find that particular folder as the folders are named according to their developer’s name/company. There were 6 other folders inside that database folder. The task here was to find which one is related to the data entered in the game’s database. I went through all those 6 folders one by one. It took me a hour or two to find that particular and to implement what i was planning to do. My main task was to increase the battle points to buy store items and my rank or experience to reach the highest level. </p>
<h2>Things to execute</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and Install DA2 Mini Militia.</li>
<li>Play 2 or 3 games after successful installation.</li>
<li>Root the phone.
There are so many applications available which does this task. E.g., Kingroot, Kingoroot etc.</li>
<li>Download and Install ES file explorer or any other root explorer applications. 
If you have installed ES, then you have to enable root explorer by going through options available after clicking 3 dot menu.</li>
<li>Go through the root folder of the phone by using ES.
   <code>sh
   Root folder-&gt;Data-&gt;Data-&gt;com.appsomniacs-&gt;preferred text-&gt;search for battle points-&gt;then edit according to you.</code></li>
</ol>
