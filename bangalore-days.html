                <h1>Bangalore Days</h1>
<p>So it has been 7 months since I have been in Bangalore. Quite a busy and fast-going city it is with people always in hurry. I remember I was feeling so nervous while coming here as i knew life won’t be same after and i was preparing myself for that. I was also feeling relieved because of my elder brother, who has been living here from the past 1 year, as I knew I won’t be alone in this new city. He made it so easy that i didn’t even realize i was living in a new strange city. The main purpose of coming here was to find a job and get settled. And i was all prepared for it. My early days in here were hectic as i was attending different interviews in different places.  And i was quite enjoying because all of this was a learning experience for me. It was 2nd week of my living here when ‘Coronavirus’ was in the early phase in India and the government was preparing to get a hold on it. It was 22nd march, day of ‘Janata Curfew’, when the whole India was in quarantine for the first time. That day my elder brother woke me up at 7 in the morning to shoot a video on this quarantine. I was half asleep when he was elaborating the concept. After that i went towards the window to see the situation outside and i was shocked to see that people were strictly following that curfew. All the shops were closed with hardly 1-2 people on the road. </p>
