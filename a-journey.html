                <p>So its been like 4 months since I came home from college after completing my undergraduate. The road was long and full of ups and downs. Technically it was more downs than ups. I never did anything productive in my stay at college which would help me in getting placed in any company. Since my fresher year, I was so distracted from my course that I didn't study anything related to that. Despite that, I got addicted to one of the popular phone games of that time <em>“DA2: Mini Militia”</em>. I didn't like this game in the first place but I kept playing. Slowly and slowly I got a good grip on this game. At that time, the college’s gaming culture was organizing Intra-College Mini Militia Championship. So I thought of entering into this. I wanted to test my skills. And I did. I was going well from the first round. But I remember, in the semi-final round, I felt like I won't be able to qualify for the final because I was barely getting kills. But I didn't give up. I tried my best and qualified for the final. I was so geared up for the final round. From the beginning of the round, I was leading with the maximum kills. In the end, I was on the top with 24 kills. I knew I could do that. Being the winner I received a trophy, a certificate, and a cash prize. I enjoyed that moment a lot. After this, I got addicted to this game even more. There was also a pro version of this which you have to pay some amount to get that. I didn't want to invest money in it. So I tried to experiment in the backend with the game data to find any loopholes to get the pro version even without paying for it. After days of searching and experimenting, I finally got one. That was one happy day. I felt like a hacker that day and it was such a nice feeling. That particular day I played the game all night. I couldn't sleep because of excitement. This addiction ended when I got a different addiction. From the end of 1st sem to the mid of 5th sem, that was my journey with “DA2”.</p>
<p>After getting detached from DA2, I got addicted to a different game. it was PokemonGo. I used to play this when it was launched. But left playing after some time. Then I started again. And from this, I got addicted to the Pokemon anime. From the beginning of the day to the end of the night I used to binge-watch the pokemon series. I was getting so much involved in this that I used to skip my meals and used to imagine myself in the anime. Sounds kiddish but yeah could not control me. The anime was kinda motivational too if you dig dip into that. When I was watching this series I got the urge of watching all those animes which used to broadcast on TV when I was a kid like Beyblade, Inazuma Eleven, Dragon Ball Z, etc. I binge-watched all of them. It was completely a waste of time even I knew that but never know why I didn't stop myself.</p>
<p>After completing that series milestone, I got addicted to one of the popular games of the present time, <em>PUBG</em>. Like DA2 I didn't like this in the first place either. Maybe because I was still understanding the mechanism, working or strategy of the game. But I kept playing. All-day and night. I used to practice a lot. I remember I used to play this game for 5-6hrs straight without eating anything to get the grip on it. After having some experience in it I started competing with different players from the world. And achieved Ace rank for 3 consecutive seasons with the K/D ratio of 6.98. The game started getting laggy more than before so I stopped playing it. Then I shifted myself to another online FPS game, <strong>CS-GO</strong>. One of the best games I have played to date.</p>
<p>CS-GO was very much different from all the games I had played. Aiming and maintaining accuracy was difficult. I struggled with it a lot. But after some continuous practices, playing numerous rounds and dying without any kill, I got hang of it. Slowly and slowly I was getting good in it. I was good in close combat so I started focusing on it. Played many competitive matches to compete with different good players from all over the world. I used to watch the plays of the best CSGO players to learn some tricks and techniques from them. That used to be quite helpful. Seeing them used to charge me up to play like them. And that did help me a lot. Currently, I am ranked as Master Guardian Elite(6th rank among 18 different ranks). Call it an escape from reality or companion in every path, but playing games was everything to me.</p>
<p>It was the month of May when my final semester exams were going on, I stopped playing every game. Maybe because I was going one on one with reality. And that was scary. I remember it was the day before leaving college, I was both scared and sad. I didn't want to leave that place because that was my comfort zone. There were no restrictions on anything. And leaving that place was scaring me.  </p>
